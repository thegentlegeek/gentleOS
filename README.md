# gentleOS: My NixOS & Home Manager Configuration

This repository houses my personal NixOS and Home Manager configurations, designed for reproducible and declarative system management. It's structured to clearly separate host-specific settings from shared user configurations and common programs.

This project is very much a work in progress and a learning experience for me. Do not take anything you see in the repository as being prescriptive, I am learning Nix and NixOS in addition to proper "programming" methodology and structuring projects so while this is open source, I don't recommend copying anything from this repo in its current state. You've been warned lol

## Overview

This repository serves as the central hub for managing my NixOS systems and Home Manager user environments. By leveraging the power of Nix, I aim to achieve a highly consistent, portable, and declarative configuration across all my machines.

## Repository Structure

[TODO]

## Key Features (or at least the goal...)

* **Declarative System Management**: All configurations are defined in Nix, ensuring reproducibility.
* **Modular Design**: Configurations are broken down into small, manageable modules for easy organization and reusability.
* **User and Host Separation**: Clear distinction between user-specific (Home Manager) and host-specific (NixOS) settings.
* **Shared Configurations**: Common program settings, services, and window manager configurations are centralized to avoid duplication.
* **Multiple Host Support**: Easily manage configurations for different machines (workstation, servers).

## Getting Started

## Contributing

Suggestions and contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for improving the structure, adding common modules, or fixing issues, please feel free to open an issue or pull request. I welcome the opportunity to learn from others!
